### What’s the expectation for new grads? It’s pretty obvious that most new grads don’t have experience managing large product teams.

Yah great question, first, the interviewer should know this and tune their questions accordingly. That said, you will still get questions about, say, conflict resolution. Ideally you have some examples from university projects or internships to lean on.

In the case where you don't have an example, thats ok too, don't lie and instead propose a hypothetical that demonstrates how you would handle such a situation. For example:

"Although I have been fortunate to work in small, friendly teams during my internships where no significant conflicts arose, I understand that conflicts can occur in any work environment. If I were to face a conflict with a colleague, I would approach it using the following strategies... "

Then mention some combination of the below:
Address the issue early: I would address the conflict as soon as I become aware of it to prevent it from escalating further. I believe that open communication is crucial in resolving misunderstandings and fostering a healthy work environment.
Focus on the problem, not the person: I would ensure that the discussion revolves around the issue at hand and not the individuals involved. This helps to maintain a professional atmosphere and prevents the conversation from becoming personal or emotional.
Active listening: I would listen carefully to the other person's perspective, making sure to understand their concerns and point of view. This demonstrates respect and empathy, which can go a long way in resolving conflicts.
Finding common ground: I would try to identify areas of agreement and shared goals between the conflicting parties. This helps to create a collaborative atmosphere and encourages teamwork in resolving the issue.
Seek a win-win solution: I would aim for a resolution that benefits all parties involved, rather than seeking a compromise where someone feels they have lost. This may involve brainstorming multiple potential solutions and selecting the one that best addresses everyone's needs.
Escalate when necessary: If we were unable to resolve the conflict ourselves, I would involve a manager or HR representative to help mediate the situation and find a suitable resolution.
