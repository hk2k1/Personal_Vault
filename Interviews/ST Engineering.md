## Behaviour Questions

### Points
- your technology seems to align with my skill set and I am hoping it would be an opportunity for me to grow 
- I want to work on interesting problems with good people. The industry you're in and the products you offer
- a positive working environment is the best way to improve my skills and stay engaged with other professionals in my field
### Tell me about yourself
- Summarise myself I love to learn, code and grow
- I am graduating from SIT studying computer engineering.
- I took this academic path so that I can learn about both hardware and software domains and choose my career path from that
- During my course, I learnt about python and c++ and got a couple of certifications along the way
- My first internship was at Continental Automotive which is in the automotive industry
	- It was my first time getting hands on experience, I worked along a senior engineer and handled part of his larger project
	- At the end of my internship, I presented it successfully to Conti's Business Unit
- In my second internship at MediaTek which is in the Semiconductor Industry
	- My role can be summarised into 2 things
		- Web Development and Scripting
	- A few key things that I did
		- Due to some company policy restrictions, things like GitHub were firewall blocked at MediaTek, so I helped my team in setting up a local git server that could be accessed only by our internal staff
		- With this I created a CI/CD pipeline for collaboration and to automate the deployment to our tests and production servers
		- Learnt a lot of new stuff like cms, reactjs, nextjs and i am using that knowledge to do my final year project 
- And that brings me here, I would like the opportunity to start my career at ST Engineering
### Why ST Engineering? Why software engineer?

- I first came across ST Engineering during my national service.
- When i was cleaning the SAR21 Rifle, the "made by ST Engineering" was imprinted on it.
- That made me curious on how the company is so essential to our defence.
- With my background in computer engineering, where I've worked on both software and hardware projects, I feel like this is a place where I can really contribute and grow
- I want to bring what I've learned so far and grow in a place where there is opportunity to work on projects that have big impact.

### What do you know about Aerospace and UAV
- ST engineering is a major player in aerospace, electronics, land systems and marine technology sectors
- I read that it is organised into commercial aero and defence aerospace and also smart city
- Under Aerospace it has things like the maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO) services
- And the Unmanned Aircraft Systems UAS side.
- UAS solutions basically revolutionize traditional operations
- By providing real-time data and safer efficient processes
- Manual work like infrastructure inspection, delivery services, security can be made more safer and efficient
- One of those solutions is DroNet
- So DroNet is a drone agnostic operating platform for Beyond Visual Line of Sight Operations, which basically enables drones to perform tasks that were previously impossible.
- Im particularly excited about the potential to contribute to projects like DroNet where innovation is the forefront.

- Which is like autonomous Drone platform where drones do not need a 1-1 controller rather just use a Hub to communicate 
- Used in shore to ship, security stuff
### Career Goals
- I love solving problems with technology and the aim is to solve them at a bigger scale in 5 years
- I want to grow as a professional in the industry and specialize in my technical skills and become an expert. I want to eventually move into a Full stack development role where I can tackle more challenges with the experience I gained.
- One of my long term vision, is to get my masters in maybe product management, and take on leadership roles to lead a team or mentor junior engineers and manage key aspects of product development.
- I’m really excited about the aerospace industry. I hope that in five years, I’m continuing to get better at skills, contributing and make a real difference with the work I do.
### Overcome a challenge, and what did you learn from that experience?
- During my internship at MediaTek, I had to setup a tool for my team to work with.
- But the challenge was this tool was blocked by the organization.
- The tool was a package manager, like maven for java, python has pip and nodejs has npm. So for php its composer and we need that for our content management systems.
- So from debugging, found out it was requesting to some GitHub APIs. So, I curled the request to find that these requests were not flowing through a proper SSL certificate setup.
- In fact prior to this, my tasks involved configuring SSL certificates for our intranet websites to make it encrypted.
- So I had some knowledge of what was wrong here
- And I got a Certificate from MediaTek IT and used it to configure the tool, and this significantly aided in our efficiency. 
- Because prior to this they have to literally download each zip file one by one. 
- I think a few takeaways that I had from these is that the tasks that I learn and do comes in handy for the future and also to keep asking myself why and it helps in finding out the root cause

### Strengths & Weaknesses
- Organisational Skills
- I believe this is what got me through University
- Started out with around 4.0 gpa in my Trimester 1
- As University progressed, I fine tuned how I basically work in terms of things like time management
- Prepare notes ahead of time
- I believe these helped me to improve my gpa
- I believe with my work ethic, I can achieve first class honours when I graduate
- On top of that I have good problem solving skills and debugging skills
- I enjoy the process of breaking down challenges and coming up with solutions.
- These skills were very valuable during my internship.

- Sometimes I can become so focused on a task that I forget to take a step back and look at the bigger picture.
- Although this focus can be good I feel like its important to pause review and align what I am working towards.
- I am trying to improve this by asking for more feedback regularly

### Greatest Achievement
- Developed **SITAtlas**, an innovative campus navigation system for Singapore Institute of Technology’s new Punggol campus as my Final Year Project.
- **Indoor-Outdoor Navigation**: Tackled the challenge of navigating between outdoor spaces and multi-level indoor environments using Mapbox GL JS. I had to develop custom solutions for indoor mapping because the existing tools weren’t sufficient.
- **AI Integration**: Integrated an AI-powered chatbot using OpenAI’s GPT-4 model. This chatbot translates user queries into GraphQL queries and uses Natural Language Processing to provide human-friendly responses.
- **Real-time Data Management**: Implemented PayloadCMS to build a robust admin panel, enabling authorized users to make real-time updates to map data.
- **Full-Stack Development**: Worked across the entire tech stack, handling frontend development with React and Next.js, and backend development with Node.js, MongoDB, and GraphQL.
- **DevOps and Deployment**: Set up a CI/CD pipeline, containerized the application with Docker, and deployed it on a DigitalOcean Virtual Private Server, using NGINX as the web server.

### how do you handle pressure ?

- I think Uni is a very good place to learn about pressure especially with multiple projects, teams and tight deadlines.
- This is how I go about it.
- So I assess the situation, like the project scope, constraints, and critical tasks.
- Once I understand the requirements by collaborating with team members.
- Prioritize the tasks based on importance and make sure we are on the same page when we work towards the same goal.
- As the project progresses, make adjustments or modify the timeline if necessary and ask for any feedback from professors if they are willing.
- All of my projects were always completed on time and met the standards I set.
- I believe these experiences reinforced my ability to handle pressure by staying organized, focused and adaptable.
### Conflict
- During my internship at Continental Automotive, we had a few iphones with UWB capabilities
- These were being used for multiple ongoing projects
- The issue was that there was no proper schedule on who could use these devices and when, which led to conflicts between teams.
- People would often ask last minute if the device was available, and this ad-hoc approach was causing frustration and delays
- So i suggested that we create a google sheet where the devices would be listed along a timeline
- and show who had booked them and when they would be available.
- So implementing this sheets made it much more organized and reduced conflicts
- So even if someone needed a device last minute they could just quickly check the sheet who had it and coordinate directly.


### Why will you be a good fit for this position?
I believe I’m a strong fit for this position because of a few key reasons. First, my experience in full-stack development and software engineering aligns closely with the technical skills required for this role. I’ve worked extensively with technologies like React, Next.js, Node.js, and MongoDB, which are central to many modern software projects. My project SITAtlas, where I developed a complex campus navigation system, demonstrates my ability to handle both front-end and back-end development, as well as my proficiency in deploying applications with Docker and managing real-time data with PayloadCMS.

Additionally, my problem-solving and debugging skills have been honed through various projects and internships, where I’ve tackled everything from firmware communication in embedded systems to automating content synchronization across websites. I’m confident that these skills will enable me to contribute effectively to the UAV projects at ST Engineering.

Beyond my technical abilities, I bring strong organizational skills and a proven work ethic. In university, I managed to maintain a high GPA while juggling multiple projects, which required careful time management and planning. I believe these attributes will help me stay focused and productive, even when working on complex or high-pressure tasks.

Finally, I have a genuine interest in the work that ST Engineering does, particularly in the aerospace and UAV sectors. I’m excited about the opportunity to contribute to innovative projects that have real-world impact, and I’m eager to bring my skills and passion to the team.

### What is something that you can improve in DroNet or some functionality you would add?

- DroNet can be used for Agriculture although Singapore may not have a very big part of it.
- Explain about the project I did in Autonomous agriculture robot
- Another application that could DroNet could be expanded into is like Nature conservation with N parks, like for example if there is a big storm, then there might be fallen branches or trees, these can be identified autonomously 
- Integration with Smart City 

### How you go about learning something new

- I can relate to how I went about it during my Internship.
- So during my time at MediaTek, I was tasked in integrating a Content Management System into an existing project.
- Previously we had utilized traditional CMS where the frontend could not be decoupled from the backend
- So my goal was to learn how to set up a headless CMS with one of our projects, which means I can have any front end running up with the CMS and integrate it with the existing project.
- I delved into Research and self study, where I researched on different CMS and choose one that matches our requirements.
- At that time I also came across NextJS, and dived into their documentation, tutorials and understanding the core concepts
- To solidify my understanding, I setup a local development environment where I could experiment with the CMS and also NextJS.
- I built a basic project to practice setting up the CMS, mongoDB and building a frontend using NextJS.
- So with this Hands On, I started integrating with the MediaTek Project, so one of the requirements was for the login page to authenticate with our LDAP Server which is basically a authentication server which contains only MediaTek Employees info.
- Throughout the process, I took feedback from my peers and supervisors to ensure the integration went  well. and as a result, it was successfully integrated 
- I expanded my technical skill set enabling me to take on more complex projects.
